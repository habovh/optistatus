# optistatus
A cool thumblr theme based on Optica from kcreate, great for explaining downtimes and issues of your server/app/service

# Description
Like Optica theme by kcreate? So do I! This one is just a little bit tweaked to be your website's/server's client's best friend!

This theme is pretty simple, I did not change much from the original theme, though I added a nice date display, and the left border of the post will get a color based on the #tags you put in the post!

Handled tags include:

- #down
- #up
- #errors
- #scheduled

So you can easily tell your users about your server status!
